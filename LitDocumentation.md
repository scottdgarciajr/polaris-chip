## When doing the tutorial, what did you get stuck on? In reading through the deck / tutorials / googling, what's not making sense?
I didn't get stuck on much. The hardest concept for me to grasp is writing HTML and CSS within the JS file, but that isn't much of an issue.

## Same, but what DOES make sense? Is this a superior approach to coding in the 'global scope' ala code pen, or does this scoping make it more complicated?
It makes sense that we have to create a declarative event listener. It also makes sense how the file is laid out similar to a Java class. Some constructors and methods can be called. The similarity to Java logic makes it easy to understand. This is by far a superior approach to coding in the 'global scope' because it allows for easy to repeatably use classes: it also makes collaboration far easier to use lit since developers aren't stepping on eachothers' toes.

## Why did you feel this was easier than the code pen based global way?
While this method may be slightly more tedious when making smaller applications, when scaling and collaborating this is going to be a worthwhile asset. The fact that multiple developers won't be all thrown into the global scope together makes teamwork easier.
